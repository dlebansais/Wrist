# Signed out

This page is displayed when the user tried to sign out, successfully or not.

If the sign in method is "login" or "login & password", this is a confirmation that they have been signed out. 

If the sign in method is "other platform", they are asked to sign out from that platform.

If the sign in method is "certificate" they are told to uninstall the certificate.

There is a button to return to the start page.
