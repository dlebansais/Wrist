# Home

Provides information about the site. A user that has started a project, even without ever logging in, will be redirected to the start page instead of home.

The home page is the first page a new user will see. It has the punch line, a sample screen shot, a list of supported features to explain what one can expect, a summary status of the site and associated services, and legal info.

The header will always offer the option to sign in since the user could be starting from a new computer. The sign in popup just asks for a name. If the name is known, but more info is needed, or if the name is not known, they are redirected to the sign in page.
