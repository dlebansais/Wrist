# Start

Starting point of a project. If a user achieves their first valid project at some point, the sign up option becomes visible.

If they have signed in in the past, the sign in option is a popup, otherwise it's the sign in/sign up page

If they are signed in, there is a popup with the following:

- Name, Id or certificate id (depending on the sign in method)
- Link to the sign out page
- Link to the profile page

This page shows the current state of all user's projects.
